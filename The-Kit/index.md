Listen... I drink a lot of coffee, and I've already stated that I'm an at home barista (meaning, on any given day I can produce coffee of higher quality than your dumb franchise), so I own a ton of gear, more than I should, ok, I spend too much money on a coffee hoby SUE ME!

I dont use all of it daily, but I do keep two base set up's and switch them up every once in a while.

## Home Kit.

So at home I brew coffe every morning, It's part of my morning routine and borders on the ritualistic. Sure that's needed for consistency's sake, you know to achieve the same perfect brew every time I gues...

## The office Kit

Lets get one thing straight, this is not a great setup, I mean, I currently work at a government office, there's no high end espresso machine, there's no common room so we can eat, so I have to make do... Also, stuff gets "lost" all the time, also also there's barely any storage that's not used for files... Also also also, This is a professional enviroment dammit and there's no way I'll bust out the chemestry set to brew coffee, at the office I'll follow the wise chinese mantra "Any coffee I brew is better than that starbucks shit you like to get"... Now I wont bad mouth the big brand, It just doesnt sit right in my stomach ok?

What this setup lacks in accuracy more than makes up in versatility, I've actually got more brewing options at the office than at home.

            {% endfor %}

And that's about it, sure, I use a mug but it's not really speciall or spectacular. Actually, that's not true, it is a black mug that changes colour when you pour hot liquid in it, but that's it, it's not specially insulated or shaped for aroma or anything.

There are a few things I'd like to add to this set up, a Kalita, you know, to switch it up with the V60 every now and then, a Gina brewer, this one's a smart brewer and it's sexy AF. Last but not least, I'd love a better grinder, something like a Wilfa Uniform.
