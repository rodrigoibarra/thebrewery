# Barista

Hey... so I drink a lot of coffee, and just like everything else in my life, I like to give out that info to data tracking so eventually when that sweet sweet tech comes that turns us all into immortal robots, I already have a full backup of my shit online :p

So in this project I will track my coffee consumption, not like daily dosage or how many cups I brew in a year, I'm not a data freak. This is just a place to publish what roast im currently drinking, what my gear is and maybe even some recipes.

At first I thought of making this into an app or a vue thing but to be honest, It will not be updated that frequently so my usual jekyll/netlify setup will work... I need to find a way to give Netlify some money.
