I’m gonna be honest with you, this is probably not the best burr grinder, It does it’s job but it’s not incredibly consistent, and sometimes it produces a lot of really fine particles, but grinders are expensive yo and this is an ok budget option. A sifter would help, the Kruve looks awesome but I feel like that’s cheating.
