While the name might put you off, since it's conception, the aeropress is built to make espresso like coffee, and then with the Fellow Prismo set up, that's more of a reality, if done right you might even get some bomb ass crema.

But that's not what we are here for, we here for sweet sweetr extraction.

So how do I actually do that? well here we go:

1. Heat up the water, if you got a temp controlled kettle set it up for 100ºc if not, for our fakespresso we looking for hot hot water.
2. Fakespresso unlike your bigBoi espresso, you want fine... but not finnest grind setup.
3. Put your grounds on the Aeropress, pour 50g of water and stir, gentle stirs, this is some fine coffee, not a fucking martini.
4. After 30 to 50 seconds, press your espresso and enjoy (the 30/50 is going to depend on your extraction).


And that's it, this is simple and a good way to pull an espresso like coffee.
