I like this dripper set up, it's your usual V60 shapeway but it sits inside a glass "jug" they call it decanter but it's  a jug, and decanting sounds too much like chemestry class and there's nothing scientific about my kitchen, it also comes with a silicone sleeve so you dont burn your hands while pouring or "decanting" (it has also saved me a couple of times from dropping the darn thing).
