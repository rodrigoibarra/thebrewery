This is my Piece de Resistance and quite frankly I love it. Now… It’s an expensive kettle, I know, and full disclosure I made a mistake when buying it, I thought I was getting the electric one and realized my mistake on delivery but what the hell I still love it. It is aesthetically pleasing, It has a thermometer that lets me know when that water is at it’s sweet spot temp and the counter weight on the handle makes pouring easy and did I mention it is beautiful?
