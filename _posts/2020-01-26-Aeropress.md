You might hate on te AeroPress but listen... This baby got range, you can do the classic AP recipe, inverted method, my favorite thing? The Fellow Prismo, the Prismo is a filter setup for the AeroPress that lets you brew espresso like coffe, since it's got a valve that only opens up after certain pressure, this let's me do longer extractions and play around with it. Also steep coffee.
