# What gear do i use?

Listen... I drink a lot of coffee, and I've already stated that I'm an at home barista (meaning, on any given day I can produce coffee of higher quality than your dumb franchise), so I own a ton of gear, more than I should, ok, I spend too much money on a coffee hoby SUE ME!

I dont use all of it daily, but I do keep two base set up's and switch them up every once in a while.
