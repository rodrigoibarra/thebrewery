# What gear do i use?

Listen... I drink a lot of coffee, and I've already stated that I'm an at home barista (meaning, on any given day I can produce coffee of higher quality than your dumb franchise), so I own a ton of gear, more than I should, ok, I spend too much money on a coffee hoby SUE ME!

I dont use all of it daily, but I do keep two base set up's and switch them up every once in a while.

## Home Kit.

So at home I brew coffe every morning, It's part of my morning routine and borders on the ritualistic. Sure that's needed for consistency's sake, you know to achieve the same perfect brew every time I gues...

Anyway, lets get on with this:

### Brewer - Hario V60 Drip Decanter

I like this dripper set up, it's your usual V60 shapeway but it sits inside a glass "jug" they call it decanter but it's  a jug, and decanting sounds too much like chemestry class and there's nothing scientific about my kitchen, it also comes with a silicone sleeve so you dont burn your hands while pouring or "decanting" (it has also saved me a couple of times from dropping the darn thing).

### Filters -  Hario VCF-100M

They are just paper filters... Or so you have been led to believe, but no, it does matter and who ever tells you they dont is lying also, I'm a firm believing on rinsing the filter before brewing, I use the beige ones and they do drip some guck when rinsed so I rather not have that in my morning coffee.

### Grinder - Krups GVX

I'm gonna be honest with you, this is probably not the best burr grinder, It does it's job but it's not incredibly consistent, and sometimes it produces a lot of really fine particles, but grinders are expensive yo and this is an ok budget option. A sifter would help, the Kruve looks awesome but I feel like that's cheating.

### Kettle - Fellow Stag

This is my *Piece de Resistance* and quite frankly I love it. Now... It's an expensive kettle, I know, and full disclosure I made a mistake when buying it, I thought I was getting the electric one and realized my mistake on delivery but what the hell I still love it. It is aesthetically pleasing, It has a thermometer that lets me know when that water is at it's sweet spot temp and the counter weight on the handle makes pouring easy and did I mention it is beautiful?

### Scale - Brewista Smart Scale II

This is the whole package, It has a timer and it weighs the grounds, has a silicon pad and looks good, the only thing I dislike is the orangeness of the screen but at this point Im just looking for stuff to point out.


And that's about it, sure, I use a mug but it's not really speciall or spectacular. Actually, that's not true, it is a black mug that changes colour when you pour hot liquid in it, but that's it, it's not specially insulated or shaped for aroma or anything.

There are a few things I'd like to add to this set up, a Kalita, you know, to switch it up with the V60 every now and then, a Gina brewer, this one's a smart brewer and it's sexy AF. Last but not least, I'd love a better grinder, something like a Wilfa Uniform.
