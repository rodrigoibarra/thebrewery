Lets get one thing straight, this is not a great setup, I mean, I currently work at a government office, there's no high end espresso machine, there's no common room so we can eat, so I have to make do... Also, stuff gets "lost" all the time, also also there's barely any storage that's not used for files... Also also also, This is a professional enviroment dammit and there's no way I'll bust out the chemestry set to brew coffee, at the office I'll follow the wise chinese mantra "Any coffee I brew is better than that starbucks shit you like to get"... Now I wont bad mouth the big brand, It just doesnt sit right in my stomach ok?

What this setup lacks in accuracy more than makes up in versatility, I've actually got more brewing options at the office than at home.


### Brewer - Hario V60 Plastic

This entire kit is low budget, (not low quality, good coffee will be good as long as you use good water, and good grounds) so I went with the red plastic V60, sure, it wont hold heat as well as a ceramic dripper but it does a solid job.

### Brewer - AeroPress

You might hate on te AeroPress but listen... This baby got range, you can do the classic AP recipe, inverted method, my favorite thing? The Fellow Prismo, the Prismo is a filter setup for the AeroPress that lets you brew espresso like coffe, since it's got a valve that only opens up after certain pressure, this let's me do longer extractions and play around with it. Also steep coffee.


### Filters -  Hario VCF-100M

I'd like to say theese are the same as the ones I use at home, but they are the white ones, and I've notice they dont drop as much stuff after rinsing, I have no idea why, but I'll still rinse theese bad boys.

### Grinder - Unbranded Ceramic Handgrinder

I had a Porlex Mini, that went missing so... I went for a budget option from Amazon and it really did not dissapoint, it's not a Porlex Mini but hey, if it works it works and that's it.

### Kettle - Diyeeni Pour Kettle

This is not a fancy kettle, it's actually pretty small, it holds like 500ml of water, this is not an electric kettle and no temp control, so I heat watter on a cheap communal electric kettle I let it boil and then pour using this for control... that's it.

### Scale - Ozeri Scale

This is the first scale I got when I started brewing it's old and beat up, it meassures in full units so no 17.5 grams of coffe or anything fancy here, it does it job, only con is: it uses cr2032 batteries.


Like I said, this is a budget setup, perfect for my needs at the office and it does a great job, at least a better job than the coffee place in the corner.
